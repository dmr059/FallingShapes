# Falling Shapes

This is an interactive game built with SFML in C++. In this game, various colored shapes fall from the top of the window, and the player earns points by clicking on them before they reach the bottom.

# Game Concept

Shapes of different sizes and colors fall from the top of the screen.

Each color represents a different point value:

ðŸ”´ Red â€” 50 pts

ðŸ”µ Blue â€” 25 pts

ðŸŸ£ Magenta â€” 15 pts

ðŸŸ¡ Yellow â€” 10 pts

ðŸŸ¢ Green â€” 5 pts

- Click on shapes to destroy them and gain points.

- Missed shapes reduce the player's health.

- The game ends when health reaches zero.
